-----Sluice Details-----
- The sluice takes from the vanilla panning system so any block added from another mod should work.
- The sluice efficiency and speed can be changed in the config.
- The inventory of the sluice is limited to blocks with the "pannable" attribute and will drop something that does not have it.
